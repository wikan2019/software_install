ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'


A note from one of our readers: Depending on your version of SSH you might also have to do the following changes:

Put the public key in .ssh/authorized_keys2
Change the permissions of .ssh to 700
Change the permissions of .ssh/authorized_keys2 to 640
